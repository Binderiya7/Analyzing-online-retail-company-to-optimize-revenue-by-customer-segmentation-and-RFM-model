#Customer Segmentation with Python and Plotly Using the RFM Model

#Overview

This project employs Python and Plotly to perform customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) model. The analysis is based on the Kaggle Online Retail dataset, with the goal of identifying distinct customer segments and visualizing their behavior.

#Features

- Data Source: Utilized the Kaggle Online Retail dataset, which provides comprehensive transactional data for analysis.
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and prepare it for segmentation.
- RFM Model: Applied the RFM model to segment customers based on three key metrics:
    - Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
    - Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.
    - Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends.
- Segmentation Analysis: Used customer segmentation analysis to identify distinct customer groups based on RFM metrics.
- Interactive Visualizations: Created plots using Plotly, including tree map, heat map, and bar charts, to visualize customer segments and their characteristics.

Business Impact

- Targeted Marketing: By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns to specific groups, increasing relevance and engagement.
- Resource Allocation: Helps in prioritizing high-value customers and optimizing resource allocation for marketing efforts, improving return on investment.
- Customer Retention: Insights into recency and frequency of purchases can guide strategies to re-engage lapsed customers and enhance retention.
- Strategic Planning: Provides valuable data-driven insights for strategic decision-making, such as identifying trends and opportunities for growth.

Summary

This project demonstrates the application of the RFM model for customer segmentation, leveraging Python and Plotly for data analysis and visualization. By identifying and visualizing distinct customer segments based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, the project offers actionable insights that can enhance targeted marketing, optimize resource allocation, improve customer retention, and support strategic business planning.
